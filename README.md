# Happy Garden
***Happy Garden*** is a fun game where you play as a cow, watering
**wilted flowers** while running away from deadly mutant
**fangflowers**!!!

## How to play
You move the cow with the arrow keys. Water wilted flowers with
spacebar. You will move slower while you are watering. A wilted
flower has 10 seconds before it dies. You lose the game when a
flower dies or you get zapped by a fangflower. Fangflowers are
flowers that were mutated from normal flowers. Every 15 seconds,
a flower mutates into a fangflower. Fangflowers will follow you.
